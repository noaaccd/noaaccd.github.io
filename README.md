# NOAA Comparative Climatic Data

This data was gathered from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn/comparative-climatic-data

The Comparative Climatic Data (CCD-2018) tables of meteorological elements outline the climate conditions at major U.S. weather observing stations, Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Islands. Observing sites presently in use as well as former sites with comparable exposure provide these data. The tables of observed data omit stations that have less than three years of data for the current operating site. The Normals, Means, and Extremes table contained in the Local Climatological Data Annual Summary for individual stations is in this publication.

### DataTables

The stations list is alphabetically by state. The table arrangement is so a single table of the same element allows the user to compare the values for different locations. Some elements will not be in the table for weather stations that do not regularly report that element. Asterisks (*) denote average frequency of occurrence greater than zero but smaller than one-half.

Temperature - Highest of Record, °F  
Temperature - Lowest of Record, °F  
Mean Number of Days Maximum Temperature 90°F or Higher  
Mean Number of Days Minimum Temperature 32°F or Less  
Mean Number of Days with Precipitation 0.01 Inch or More  
Snowfall (Including Ice Pellets and Sleet) - Average Total in Inches  
Wind - Average Speed (MPH)  
Wind - Maximum Speed (MPH)  
Sunshine - Average Percent of Possible  
Sunshine - Average Percent of Possible (Cities Listed by Ranking Most to Least)  
Cloudiness - Mean Number of Days (Clear, Partly Cloudy, Cloudy)  
Average Relative Humidity - Morning (M), Afternoon (A)  

### Climate Normals
Note: The tables below contain the new 1981–2010 Normals data.

Normal Daily Maximum Temperature, °F  
Normal Daily Minimum Temperature, °F  
Normal Daily Mean Temperature,°F  
Normal Heating Degree Days (July–June) Base 65 °F

### Table Notes
The following gives a full explanation of all symbols and caveats used to explain the values in the above data tables.

##### Observed Data (Monthly and Annual)  
The Observed Data values are the means and extremes for the period of record (number of years) indicated. Periods of record are documented in the Local Climatological Data annual publications.

- Temperature - Highest of Record, °F
- Temperature - Lowest of Record, °F
The annual temperature entry for each station represents the highest or lowest observed temperature in any month.
- Mean Number of Days with Minimum Temperature 32°F or less
The mean number of days with a minimum temperature of 32°F or lower indicates the frequency of occurrence of days with freezing temperatures.
- Mean Number of Days with Maximum Temperature 90°F or More (70°F or More for Alaska Stations)
- Mean number of Days with Precipitation 0.01 Inches or More
This table shows mean number of days per month with at least 0.01 inch of precipitation. This is the smallest amount of precipitation numerically recorded, and it includes the liquid water equivalent of frozen precipitation. The frequency of days with precipitation should not be considered as frequency of cloudy days.
- Snowfall (including ICE PELLETS and SLEET) - Average Total in Inches
Note: Beginning in April 1988 HAIL is also included under Snowfall. Therefore, some stations may show snowfall during the warm months.
- Wind - Average Speed (MPH)
The average wind speed is based on the speed of the wind regardless of direction.
- Wind - Maximum Speed (MPH)
This table expresses both a maximum wind speed for the stations and, where available, the direction (referenced to true North) from which it blew. Short gusts are listed only for stations denoted with a (G). If the direction is expressed as one of the 16 compass points (N, NNE, NE, etc.) the maximum speed is calculated from the minimum time during which one mile of wind passed the station. Note that some stations that report short gusts (G) may also use the 16 compass point reference for wind direction. If the direction is expressed numerically, the maximum speed is the highest one minute average value recorded by the observer. Direction is given in tens of degrees clockwise from true North.
- Sunshine - Average Percentage of Possible
The total time that sunshine reaches the surface of Earth is expressed as the percentage of the maximum amount possible from sunrise to sunset with clear sky conditions.
- Cloudiness - Mean Number of Days - Clear (CL), Partly Cloudy (PC), Cloudy (CD)
This table shows the mean number of days per category of cloudiness. The categories are determined for daylight hours only. Clear denotes zero to 3/10 average sky cover. Partly cloudy denotes 4/10 to 7/10 average sky cover. Cloudy denotes 8/10 to 10/10 average sky cover.
- Average Relative Humidity (Percent) - Morning (M) and Afternoon (A)
The relative humidity is expressed as a percentage measure of the amount of moisture in the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold at the same temperature and pressure. Average humidity values are given for selected morning and afternoon observations. Maximum relative humidity values usually occur during morning hours. In this publication, the Local Standard Time (LST) of morning and afternoon humidities are shown below.
Atlantic, Alaskan (M morning 8 a.m.) (Afternoon 2 p.m.)  
Eastern, Bering, 165°W Meridian (M morning 7 a.m.) (Afternoon 1 p.m.)  
Central, 180°E Meridian (M morning 6 a.m.) (Afternoon NOON)  
Mountain, 165°E Meridian (M morning 5 a.m.) (Afternoon 5 p.m.)  
Pacific, 150°E Meridian (M morning 4 a.m.) (Afternoon 4 p.m.)  
135°E Meridian (M morning 9 a.m.) (Afternoon 3 p.m.)  

#### Climate Normals (Monthly and Annual) 
The Climate Normals are the 30-year average values computed from the data recorded during the period 1971–2000. Normals are updated decennially, for the most recent 30-year period. If an instrument's exposure was changed, mathematical adjustments are made to make the data representative of the current location. The values are statistically determined and cannot be recreated solely from the original record.

- Normal Daily Maximum Temperature, °F
The maximum temperature data are the normal daily values for each month. They have been adjusted as necessary.
- Normal Daily Minimum Temperature, °F
The minimum temperature data are the normal daily values for each month. They have been adjusted as necessary.
- Normal Daily Mean (Average) Temperature, °F
The mean temperature data are the normal daily values for each month. They have been adjusted as necessary.
- Normal Heating Degree Days (July–June)
- Normal Cooling Degree Days (January–December)
Degree day data are used to estimate amounts of energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperature levels. Daily values are computed from each day's mean temperature (max + min/2). Each degree that a day's mean temperature is below or above 65°F is counted as one heating or cooling degree day.
- Normal Precipitation, Inches
The normal precipitation is the arithmetic mean for each month over the 30-year period, adjusted as necessary, and includes the liquid water equivalent of snowfall.
