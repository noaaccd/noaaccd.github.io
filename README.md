#NOAA Comparative Climatic Data

This data was gathered from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn/comparative-climatic-data

The Comparative Climatic Data (CCD-2018) tables of meteorological elements outline the climate conditions at major U.S. weather observing stations, Puerto Rico, and the Pacific Islands. Observing sites presently in use as well as former sites with comparable exposure provide these data. The tables of observed data omit stations that have less than three years of data for the current operating site. The Normals, Means, and Extremes table contained in the Local Climatological Data Annual Summary for individual stations is in this publication.

### DataTables

The stations list is alphabetically by state. The table arrangement is so a single table of the same element allows the user to compare the values for different locations. Some elements will not be in the table for weather stations that do not regularly report that element. Asterisks (*) denote average frequency of occurrence greater than zero but smaller than one-half.
